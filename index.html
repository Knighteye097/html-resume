        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>I have accumulated two years of hands-on experience with the Java Spring Boot framework, 
        primarily focusing on a CPQ application for a leading business partner in the healthcare industry. 
        Initially, I spearheaded the development of the Pricing component of the application. Over time, 
        my responsibilities expanded to encompass all three components of the application. I took the lead 
        in developing several of the most complex functionalities, resulting in significant reductions in 
        lag within the pricing component. Additionally, I was tasked with rebuilding the translation 
        functionality for the application. This initiative successfully broadened the application's 
        reach to various parts of the world. Apart from this throughout my 2 yrs journey, I have also 
        earned various unofficial tags like "The Fun Manager", "The local SPOC", "The choreographer" and 
        many more!!</p>
